**Neighborly** is a hyper-local, AI-enhanced web application designed to connect individuals in need with volunteers in their community. It bridges the gap between asking for help and offering it, using technology to foster real-world connections and support.

This project was built to demonstrate the power of combining a modern web stack with cutting-edge AI to solve a genuine community problem.
