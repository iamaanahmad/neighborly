**Neighborly** is a hyper-local, AI-enhanced web application designed to connect individuals in need with volunteers in their community. It bridges the gap between asking for help and offering it, using technology to foster real-world connections and support.

This project was built to demonstrate the power of combining a modern web stack with cutting-edge AI to solve a genuine community problem.

### ‚ú® Key Features

-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Assistance (Google Gemini & Genkit):**
    -   **Help Request Generation**: Users can input a rough idea of their needs (e.g., "need groceries"), and our AI assistant drafts a clear, polite, and effective request post. This is powered by the `help-request-assistance.ts` Genkit flow, which uses a Gemini prompt to transform simple user input into a well-structured request.
    -   **Smart Chat Replies**: Volunteers receive AI-generated suggestions for quick and empathetic replies, making communication faster and friendlier. The `chat-suggestion.ts` flow analyzes the conversation history and suggests context-aware responses, improving the interaction between helpers and seekers.
    -   **Content Moderation**: Every request is automatically scanned by the `moderate-text.ts` Genkit flow to ensure a safe and respectful community environment. The AI checks for profanity, hate speech, and other inappropriate content, automatically flagging or blocking posts that violate community guidelines.

-   **‚ö° Real-Time & Role-Based:**
    -   **Live Request Board**: The "Offer Help" page updates in real-time with new requests from the community. This is achieved using a Firestore `onSnapshot` listener in the `offer-list.tsx` component, ensuring volunteers always see the most current needs.
    -   **Instant Messaging**: A secure, real-time chat connects seekers and helpers to coordinate details privately. Built on Firestore, it allows for instant communication, complete with AI-suggested replies for helpers.
    -   **Role-Based Dashboards**: The user experience is tailored to whether a user signs up as a **Seeker** (needs help), a **Helper** (offers help), or **Both**. The dashboard dynamically displays relevant actions and information based on the user's role.

-   **üîí Secure & Scalable Backend:**
    -   **Firebase Authentication**: Secure email/password and demo user login flows are handled by Firebase Auth.
    -   **Firestore Database**: All application data, including users, requests, and chat messages, is stored and managed in Firestore, providing real-time data synchronization and a scalable data structure.
    -   **Admin Insights Dashboard**: A built-in dashboard provides a high-level overview of community activity, including user stats and request statuses, showcasing the platform's potential for management.

-   **üé® Modern & Responsive UI:**
    -   Built with **Next.js App Router** for a fast, server-first experience with optimized routing.
    -   Styled with **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI** for a clean, beautiful, and fully responsive interface that looks great on any device.
    -   Includes a user-toggleable light/dark mode theme.
